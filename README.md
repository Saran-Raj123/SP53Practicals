# SP53_CP1404_Practicals

## Introduction:

This repository serves as a reflection on the principles of every week practicals in the context of a programming 2 subject. I aim to share insights gained from every week  practices.

## About Me:

I am Saranraj Saravanan, currently enrolled in Bachelor of Information Technology at James Cook University. This reflection captures my understanding of python coding and showcasing my coding practices.

## Lessons Learned:

- Meaningful Variable Names: The importance of choosing descriptive and meaningful variable names became evident throughout the subject. Clear and concise names enhance code readability and make maintenance more straightforward.

- Code Documentation: The significance of comprehensive and well-structured documentation became apparent during the course. Clear comments, docstrings, and README files contribute to the understandability of the codebase. Documenting not just the "how" but also the "why" behind certain design decisions bring up collaboration and long-term maintainability.

- Version Control Best Practices: Understanding and utilizing version control systems, such as Git, is crucial for maintaining clean code. Regular commits, meaningful commit messages.
